what is hashing

arbitrary sized key --> H(key) --> Hashed key

what are hash functions (H(key))

1) H(input1) = output1 always
2) Aperfect Hash function always produces unique output for unique input.

Generally used hash function

1) Division
h(k) = k mod M

2) Mid Square Method
indices available - 0 to 99

H(60) -> 16 * 16  = 256

3) Digit Folding Method
I) divide the digit into segment of equal size (s)
II) take sum of segments -> (SUM)
III) SUM % M (where M is the size of table)
