# Complete Binary Tree
All the levels are full, except last level, it is full from left to right

# Full/Strict Binary Tree
Each node has either 0 children or 2 children

# Perfect Binary Tree
All the internal nodes have 2 children and all the leaf nodes are on the same level
if height is h, then total nodes = 2^(h+1) - 1
leaf nodes = 2^h
N = no of leaves ======> log(n+1) levels atleast
N = no of nodes =======> log(n+1) min levels


# Height Balanced Tree
avg height = O(log n)

# Skewed Binary Tree
Every node has only one child
height = O(n) --> n = no of nodes

# Oredered Binary Tree
Every node has some property that is follows. Example: BST

# Segment Tree
It is a binary tree which has interval info and operation which we have to perform

Segment tree is a full binary tree

# interval info like 
index from 2 to 4

# operation 
sum, multiply of elements
